    title: 'Healthy Boundaries & Clear Communication',
    subtitle: 'Saying no with clarity instead of chronic resentment',
    shortDescription: 'The psychological practice of defining personal limits on your time, emotional energy, and resources without passive aggression or hostility.',
    oneLineExplanation: 'A boundary is not a wall to punish others; it is a door with a latch to preserve your own well-being.',

    summary30s: 'A boundary is not a wall to punish other people; it is a clear statement of what you will do to preserve your own energy, time, and sanity without anger or passive aggression.',
    // 1. What is it?
    coreConcept: 'A boundary is an explicit statement of what you will or will not do. It is NOT an attempt to control another person\'s behavior; it is a clear declaration of how you will respond when your personal threshold of time, dignity, or energy is reached.',
    summary60s: 'When you say "yes" to a request while your internal emotional battery is screaming "no", you build silent resentment. Over months, that unspoken frustration leaks out as passive aggression, snarky comments, or sudden explosions. Setting a calm, polite boundary preserves the relationship.',
    quickTakeaways: [
      'A boundary governs your own actions, not someone else\'s personality',
      'Uncommunicated expectations are premeditated resentments',
      'Saying no to an unreasonable demand is saying yes to your own psychological integrity',
    ],

    // 2. Why does it happen?
    whyItHappens: 'Fear of interpersonal rejection and social disapproval. People-pleasing is often an anxious coping strategy: we fear that asserting our needs will lead to abandonment or anger from loved ones.',
    evolutionaryMechanism: 'In small ancestral bands, maintaining the goodwill of tribal elders and peers was essential for resource sharing and physical survival.',

    // 3. How does it work?
    howItWorks: 'Healthy boundary setting follows a 3-part framework: (1) Observation without blame ("When work calls arrive past 9:00 PM"); (2) Impact ("I cannot unwind for sleep"); (3) Boundary action ("I will be switching my phone to do-not-disturb at 9:00 PM and responding at 8:30 AM tomorrow").',

    // 4. What does research say?
    researchSummary: 'Supported by Marshall Rosenberg\'s Nonviolent Communication (NVC) and Harriet Lerner\'s clinical research (The Dance of Anger). Studies consistently confirm that individuals with clear, non-aggressive boundaries report lower cortisol levels and higher relationship longevity.',
    limitationsAndControversies: 'IMPORTANT SCIENTIFIC NUANCE: On social media, pop-psychology often weaponizes "boundaries" to justify emotional callousness or refusing any normal relational compromise. In reality, healthy relationships require reciprocal flexibility. Do not diagnose or label your family members as "toxic" simply because they have differing needs.',
